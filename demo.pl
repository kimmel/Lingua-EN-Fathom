q{In general, construction of pictograms follows the general procedure used in 
constructing bar charts. But two special rules should be followed! First, all 
of the picture units used must be of equal size. The comparisons must be made 
wholly on the basis of the number of illustrations used and never by varying 
the areas of the individual pictures used. The reason for this rule is obvious. 
The human eye is grossly inadequate in comparing areas of geometric designs. 
Second, the pictures or symbols used must appropriately depict the quantity to 
be illustrated. A comparison of the navies of the world, for example, might 
make use of miniature ship drawings. Cotton production might be shown by bales 
of cotton. Obviously, the drawings used must be immediately interpreted by the 
reader.};
