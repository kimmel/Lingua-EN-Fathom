=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module analyses English text in either a string or file. Totals are 
then calculated for the number of characeters, words, sentences, blank
and onon blank (text) lines.

Three common readablity statistics are also derived, the Fog, Flesch and
Kincaid indices. 

All of these properties can ve accessed through individual methods, or by
generatring a text report.
